Growing Shade is a unique tool that highlights stories and allows users to create custom reports to inform tree canopy enhancement and preservation for the Dane County, Wisconsin region. 

There are additional tools and resources that may be useful for this work.  Please consider the list below as a starting point. Additionally, when planning and prioritizing urban forestry work, tools and data cannot substitute for stakeholder engagement to understand community-specific concerns or opportunities. The on-the-ground knowledge of residents and the expertise of local practitioners are valuable sources of information.
